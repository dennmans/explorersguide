# Introduction

This guide is a way to document my work so that others can reuse, build upon and add to it.  That way we can create a community of explorers that can share knowledge whilst also sharing the cost of uncovering and developing ways of working.

The outputs will be published to:
- a github repository
- pages on the P2P Wiki
- a YouTube channel
- a Medium channel
- a LeanPub book
- a LeanPub course
- a developer community
- a user group
