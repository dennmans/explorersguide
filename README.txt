# The Explorer's Guide to the Corporate Jungle

When I went into development from being a sailor, I looked for an equivalent to a Scouting handbook, an SAS survival guide or a Nautical Almanac for exploring my new environment.  Whereas there were clearly initiatives for working in (many) self-managing teams, empirical process control, developing strategy, designing for humans and mastering the environment, the initiatives that bring these together are either proprietary 'frameworks' or only cover one of the aspects of exploring.  These initiatives are often financed by gatekeeping intellectual property and/or certifications - making it difficult or illegal to remix or build upon them.  After spending many years exploring, I want to build up a community where we bring together what we've discovered but in a Peer to Peer community, using commons licensing.  

This guide will be modular and will make use of community contributions.  It is provided as-is, based on the practitioners' experiences.  It should not be mistaken for a complete body of knowledge nor a meta-study of best practices.  If relevant knowledge or practices are missing or outdated, we will make a best attempt to update this guide, such that it is most useful to its users.  The Explorer's Guide is released under a GPLv3 license, we will cite or attribute everything to the source material - if you use, remix or build upon the contents of the Explorer's Guide, you are required to do the same.  That said - we would be happy to include your experiences too, please help us by contributing!
